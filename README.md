# Week-9-Honeypot

Greetings Ladies and Sirs!
This week we created a honeypot to lure in unsuspecting hackers. Already we've got a multinational crew throwing a barrage of attacks.
To start, I used my new favorite cloud provider. <color='red'>vultr.com!</color> I like it because it is lightweight and simple to use. I enjoy that it is also quite cheap.
